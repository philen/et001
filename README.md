# Engine Test 001

This is a basic test of using the libGDX framework from Scala in a desktop environment (OS X, Windows, Linux).

## Usage

Assuming you are using IDEA, set up a Run/Debug configuration:

  * "Add Configuration"
  * add an "Application"
  * set Main class to "et001.Main"
  * set module classpath to "et001"

When compiled and run, it will open a native window with title bar and controls and display the libGDX logo on a flashing background. The window will be resizable and closable.

## Tooling

* [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) - The language
* [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) - The development environment
* [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) - The game development framework
